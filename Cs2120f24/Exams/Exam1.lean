# Exam 1

This is an individual exam. You must complete it entirely on your own,
with no outside inputs of any kind other than in response to questions
posed directly to the instructor. You must take the exam while in class
in the classroom. When you come in to the classroom, spread yourselves
out, mix up, and do sit where you or someone you know of might hope to
catch a glance.

The sources of propositions on this exam will prominently include those
in the two files, Library/PropLogic/identities.lean

/- #1

Given a proposition in propositional logic, express it in precise English.

Given a proposition in propositional logic in English, formalize it in the
language of propositional logic as we've embedded it in Lean4.

In either case:

- Give examples of formal interpretations and "model check" (evaluate) them
- Write (within a Lean comment block) a truth table for the overall proposition
- If there are counter-examples, pick one and explain in English exactly why it's one

/- #2

Given a proposition in propositional logic in Lean4, rewrite it to make
all implicit parentheses explicit, accounting for both associativity and
precedence (binding strength) properties of concrete operator notations.

Given a proposition in propositional logic in Lean4, rewrite it to
remove as many parentheses as you can without changing its meaning.

/-! #3

Be able to show that you truly and fully understand the meaning of implication.

/-! #4

Give a specification of the formal syntax and operational semantics of a tiny
little language, show that you fully understand what it's saying by filling in
a few missing bits or explaining particularly important elements. Concepts will
include abstract syntax (including literal, variable, and operator expressions),
concrete syntax concepts, interpretations, and the procedure for evaluating the
truth of an expression given an interpretation (semantic evaluation).
